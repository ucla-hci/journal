{"title":"What a good day","content":"Until now, I can't say that I totally recovered from this experience. It made me feel afraid of collaboration. Before this event, I feel I enjoyed every moment working in a team. This experience especially hurt me because it happened between me and one teammate who used to have a close relationship with me. But one morning, we both had great pressure on pushing forward the progress. When I pointed out that one more modification should be done as soon as possible, he suddenly went mad, shouted at me and threw the device into the table, making a huge sound. I was scared, but I found myself still pretending to be calm enough to deal with the situation. I just walked away in case he would have more behaviors out of control. Then I talked with the manager of the lab and later the team member also sent a very short sorry message. I feel something has happened in my mind deeply. I feel this message was useless and meaningless to me. And I refused to recover from this event. Every time I had to go to the place where it happened, I recalled all the memories and felt bad. I spent almost two or three days just uncontrollably weeping occasionally.","date":"12/07/2020 0:26","flag":1,"marks":[]}
