{"title":"Just so so","content":"COVID-19 has made my schooling 10x difficult then it should be. I failed all my classes and lost my financial aid because of it. I hate the online class format. I’ve become more depressed than usual to the point I’ve been getting suicidal thoughts. Being suck at home with children around you has been pressuring, having no where to go. I can’t go up into a class without passing a under 100 class that I really hate because of how the teachers are hardcore doing it with limit time. One of them requested that I should go even lower if I don’t understand material which has made me lost all support from the school itself.","date":"07/27/2020 2:30","flag":2,"marks":[]}
