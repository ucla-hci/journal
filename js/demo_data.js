I was sopposed to talk with some one from the frontend department, but my interviewer was actually a backend engineer. So the process goes a little werid. He was trying to give me question that has both frontend and backend relationships while I was just trying hard to answer them with my knowledge limited to the frontend field. Luckily I got pass otherwise I may blame my HR for being not so professional on this.\n\nI was thinking to take a break today but got waken by phone call from mainland China. They informed me to take coding test tomorrow at 4 AM. Which is the worst time window that I perfer to work. As a result, I have to stay up without sleeping tonight. Then, spent 2 hours on coding problems. Go to sleep for couple hours and get up again to prepare another test invitaion from TikTok tomorrow afternoon. What a day.","date":"08/15/2020 14:25","marks":[{"tag":"pause-hl 0","from":{"line":0,"ch":44},"to":{"line":0,"ch":45}},{"tag":"fluent-hl
