Previously, my world was small and I just focused on the things that happened around me. Now, I feel I am sitting on a little boat, floating on the waves of the sea. I started to think about what is meaningful to me. I have tons of things to do every day. Did these make me feel happy? Now, one year later, or ten years later? Why do I spend my effort and time on them? I don't have an answer in my mind now. Before I figure it out, I just want to slow down a little bit and keep going. \n\nUntil now, I can't say that I totally recovered from this experience. It made me feel afraid of collaboration. Before this event, I feel I enjoyed every moment working in a team. This experience especially hurt me because it happened between me and one teammate who used to have a close relationship with me. But one morning, we both had great pressure on pushing forward the progress. When I pointed out that one more modification should be done as soon as possible, he suddenly went mad, shouted at me and threw the device into the table, making a huge sound. I was scared, but I found myself still pretending to be calm enough to deal with the situation. I just walked away in case he would have more behaviors out of control. Then I talked with the manager of the lab and later the team member also sent a very short sorry message. I feel something has happened in my mind deeply. I feel this message was useless and meaningless to me. And I refused to recover from this event. Every time I had to go to the place where it happened, I recalled all the memories and felt bad. I spent almost two or three days just uncontrollably weeping occasionally.\n","date":"08/15/2020 13:47","flag":1,"mouse":[],"key":[]},"mark":{"commentLog":{"1":{"tag":"others","comment":"As a good friend of myself, I will say to myself, \"wow! it is so glad to hear that you feel better than before"},"2":{"content":"I can't","tag":"pause","comment":"I think I have a lot of uncertainties in my mind, kind of a mess, mixing together, which hindered me from describing them.","from":{"line":0,"ch":80,"sticky":"after","xRel":3.387451171875},"to":{"line":0,"ch":87,"sticky":"before","xRel":-3.8250732421875}},"3":{"content":"I have tons of things to do every day.

I moved away from the US - or at least got moved out while I wasn't there - and I am suddendly everywhere and nowhere. I can tell that I am becoming depressed again, this feeling of not knowing where to go, feeling like my self-worth is tied to what I am doing and currently I feel like I am doing nothing: I will be out of work in September and feel like such a failure. But I am also sick of my life being like this. Why can't I just be happy? \nRight now, I just don't want to do anything, I just want to get up and leave. But where am I going? I feel like I have the responsibility to take care of myself, to work. I am in my early 30s and I feel like I haven't achieved anything. I dont' have a house, I don't have children, I don't have savings on my bank account, I don't have a career. I have lived here and there but never stuck to anywhere. I'm exhausted. And I am in a marriage but I don't know where it is going. We don't live together at the moment due to both of our working situations.

Then I had a call with my mentor and friend in the US and it really helped me. I feel bad because he's not my therapist but he's really good at giving me a different perspective. I have a hard decision to make and I think in my heart, I already know what it is but I am afraid. I though I shouldn't complain, that I have it pretty well but dealing with mental health is a battle and one that takes up a lot of energy. My friend yesterday said that we're not at the traumalympics, it doesn't matter who has the worst trauma. We all have reason for why we are struggling and that's ok. \nI can tell that it's hard to motivate myself for work but I'll get through it. At least it's sunny and blue skies which makes a good Friday. I miss my friends in the US and I wish I could go back. I mean I techincally can but it doesn't make much sense at the moment. My life just got turned upside down through COVID and I am just trying to find back on my path. People here around me think it's no big deal, they didn't realize that I gave up a life in the US. For them, I was supposed to be here all along. That makes it hard sometimes.

My motivation is low and I just want to lie down and do nothing but then I have to contemplate about life and that would make me really depressed. It's interesting how I make decisions for myself and then I don't want to follow through with them. Like I will spend the next few weeks away from home to focus on my paper writing but now I am having second thoughts. It's exhausting to always focus and adjust to a new place and feel like I don't have a home or a place of my own. I feel torn between two places, here and the US where I lived for the last 5 years. And I feel like a part of me has been ripped out, it's gone and I can't get it back. It's like a suddenly woke up and someone moved me somewhere and I can't go back. Nothing is like it was before. Sometimes I feel like I am in two places at the same time. Like I am here but I close my eyes and think about the hometown for the past 5 months and it feels like I am there. I miss it so much, it hurts to think about it.

I mean the sun helps and that I am trying to get out regularly and do some sports. I have a big deadline coming up and I am a little bit anxious but it'll work out and be fine, I've done it before. I just hope that my \"normal\" life is staying somewhat calm. But I know that I need some space for myself, even though I am afraid of being alone. I need to get rid of that feeling, of second guessing each and every decision, of feeling like I can easily start questioning myself whenever I get input from outside. There's so much going on all the time. But today is a good day and I try to make progress in terms of work and chores but also take time for myself. So far, I am doing pretty well. Let's hope that that continues.
