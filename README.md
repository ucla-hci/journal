## Assisted Journaling (name TBD)
This repository tracks the development of an interactive journal intended to increase the benefits of expressive writing for a user by subtly helping them introspect on their words. Our project will automatically work with the user to help them reframe their thoughts, via the experience of collaboratively editing a journal entry alongside an artificially intelligent, guilding other.
