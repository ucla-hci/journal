Why am I obsessed with the idea I can justify myself by getting manuscripts published? Is it an escape – an excuse for any social failure – so I can say “No, I don’t go out for many extra-curricular activities, but I spent a lot of time writing.” Or is it an excuse for wanting to be alone and mediate alone, not having to brave a group of women? (Women in numbers have always disturbed me) Do I like to write? Why? About what? Will I give up and say “living and feeding a man’s insatiable guts and begetting children occupies my whole life, don’t have time to write?” Or will I stick to my damn stuff and practice? Read and think and practice? I am worried about thinking.

I am afraid that the physical sensuousness of marriage will lull and soothe to inactive lethargy my desire to work outside the realm of my mate – might make me “lose myself in him,” as I said before, and thereby lose the need to write as I would lose the need to escape. Very simple.

And there is the fallacy of existence: the idea that one would be happy forever and aye with a given situation or series of accomplishments. Why did Virginia Woolf commit suicide? Or Sara Teasdale – or the other brilliant women – neurotic? Was their writing sublimation (oh horrible world) of deep, basic desires?

Someday, god knows when, I will stop this absurd, self-pitying, idle, futile despair.
